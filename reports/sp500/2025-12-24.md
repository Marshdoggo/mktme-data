### Distribution Summary

The S&P 500 universe reveals meaningful dispersion in daily volatility and risk-adjusted returns over the last 252 trading days. Most stocks cluster around moderate volatility (~2.2% daily standard deviation) and median Sharpe of roughly 0.54. However, high Sharpe names like GEV and CEG demonstrate superior compensation for risk despite moderate volatility levels (~3-4%). In contrast, the riskiest names (e.g., NVR) exhibit elevated volatility (>26%) paired with low Sharpe ratios and severe drawdowns, reflecting heightened risk without commensurate return.

### What to Watch
